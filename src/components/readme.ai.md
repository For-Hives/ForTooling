# Components Directory Overview

This directory contains all the React components used throughout the application. It's organized to promote reusability, maintainability, and a consistent user interface.

## Directory Structure

- `app/` - Application-specific components
- `magicui/` - Advanced UI components with animations and effects
- `ui/` - Basic UI components built on shadcn/ui
- `otherslib.../` - Future lib used in the app, template etc.

## Key Concepts

- **Component Hierarchy**: Organized from basic UI elements to complex compositions
- **Reusability**: Components designed for reuse across the application
- **Client vs Server Components**: Separation based on interactivity needs
- **UI Consistency**: Common design language across components

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- do not create them, we need to create / modify these elements only throught the npx commands with ShadCn

### Don't

- Create duplicate components with similar functionality
- Mix client and server code inappropriately
